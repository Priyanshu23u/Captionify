# 🖼️ AI Image Caption Generator

## 📌 Overview
The AI Image Caption Generator is a deep learning-based application that generates descriptive captions for images. It utilizes a combination of **computer vision** and **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze an image and create relevant text descriptions.

## Dataset
Flickr 8k Dataset has been used in this project. You can access it from keggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k

## 🚀 Features
- Upload an image and get a **real-time AI-generated caption**.
- Uses **pre-trained deep learning models** (CNN & LSTM) for feature extraction and caption generation.
- Clean **Streamlit-based web UI** for an interactive experience.
- Custom **caption styles** (descriptive, creative, technical, emotional).
- **Download captioned images** or copy captions for sharing.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit  
- **Backend**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, PIL  
- **Machine Learning**: CNN (for image feature extraction), LSTM (for caption generation)  
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud / Docker / Local Hosting
